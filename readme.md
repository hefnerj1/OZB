# Os zygomaticum bipartitum


> Os zygomaticum bipartitum (OZB; also known as Os japonicum) is a cranial nonmetric trait characterized by the division of the zygomatic bone into two or more segments (Figure 1 ). This study presents a comprehensive review of OZB, drawing from the literature to clarify morphological variability and population incidence. The goals of this study include:
Development of standardized line drawings to illustrate the character states of OZB; and,
Analyze the relationship between Os zygomaticum bipartitum, age, biological sex, and population affinity using the worldwide dataset freely provided by Ossenberg (1970).
This research contributes to bioarchaeology, forensic anthropology, and comparative anatomy by refining OZB classification systems, enhancing data collection consistency for data sharing and data analysis, and by providing frequency distribution data and inter-trait correlation coefficients. These data, along with the more nuanced understanding of the ontogenetic development of OZB we provide, build from previous work in the MSU MaMD Laboratory examining classification schemes and the growth & development of a graphic library for interparietal bones.
